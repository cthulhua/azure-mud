Between you and the Orb, however, are dozens of chess pieces larger than yourself, scattered about the board as if midway through a game.<br/><br/>You take a few steps towards the Orb and nothing happens. Maybe this won't be too complicated? But on your next step, a Knight swoops in and knocks you down; you've been Captured. You eye the square you started at, yards back. Why walk all the way? You just return to the last safe square you were at and try a different path. It works! You've gone another few steps when your foot lands on a white square and a Bishop you hadn't noticed swoops in from the far side of the board and caroms into you. Ok, well, you're *definitely* not going to go back to the starting square now; you just slink back to where you were before the Bishop attack and try again.<br/><br/>Thus you make your way, in fits and starts, to the Orb, backing up to safe spaces when you encounter danger to feel out a new path. Eventually you arrive, but the Orb seems to be attached to the pedestal through a mechanism unknown to you.
